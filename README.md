# prettier.el

`prettier.el` reformats your code by running
[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) with minimal
overhead, by request or transparently on file save.

Overhead on top of Prettier registers in the range of single-digit
milliseconds for reasonably sized files on a decent system.

Prettier is run in a long-running process so that Node startup
overhead is only paid once, and so that V8 JIT compilation has a
better opportunity to work its magic.

Additional features include first-class support for reformatting
remote files via `tramp-mode` and wide integration with other major
modes.

This is not the official Prettier integration for Emacs. The official package
can be found at
[https://github.com/prettier/prettier-emacs](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-emacs).

## Installation

This package is not yet on MELPA because it's not as stable as
`prettier-emacs`. For now, head to the [Releases
page](https://github.com/jscheid/prettier.el/releases/) and download
a tarball, then `M-x package-install-file` if you're feeling lucky.

A `node` executable needs to be on `exec-path`. It is recommended to
provide a recent version of Node since older versions tend to be
significantly slower. `prettier.el` also uses the Emacs `nvm` package
so that if you have [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), all you
need to do is run `nvm install node` to ensure the latest version is
available.

The Prettier package needs to be installed inside your npm package, or
globally with either `npm` or `yarn`. Version 1.6 is the minimum
requirement but it's recommended to use the latest version in order to
get access to all parsers, features and bugfixes.

You can use `M-x prettier-info` to see which versions are being used
for a given buffer and to aid with diagnosis when Node or Prettier
can't be found.

The above instructions are for reformatting local files; see below for
how to configure remote systems.

Use `M-x global-prettier-mode` to turn on `prettier-mode` in all major
modes supported by your version of Prettier and any plugins installed
(see [prettier-mode-enabled-parsers](#prettier-mode-enabled-parsers)
below.) When enabled, the minor mode will reformat on file save and
also sync settings from Prettier to Emacs, such as indentation level.

To enable `prettier-mode` globally and permanently:

```elisp
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-prettier-mode)
```

## Usage

When enabled as a minor mode, `prettier-mode` formats your source code
on save.

You can also `M-x prettier-prettify` to prettify the whole buffer at
any time in any buffer (doing so doesn't require the minor mode to be
enabled), and `M-x prettier-prettify-region` to prettify region (but
note that region should align with a complete block of code).

If you give a prefix argument to either of these two commands you will
be able to set/override the Prettier parser to use for formatting.

### Changing Prettier Configuration

After you change Prettier options (by creating, modifying or deleting
Prettier configuration files), `prettier-mode` won't pick up the
changes automatically. Disable and re-enable `global-prettier-mode` to
force reloading the new configuration. This might be improved in the
future by monitoring relevant files for changes.

### On Remote Servers

When you edit files on a remote host, Prettier will be run remotely on
that host. It follows that the remote host needs to have Node and
Prettier installed as described above. `nvm` can't be used on remote
hosts; you will have to ensure `tramp-remote-path` is set correctly.

Remote formatting might be improved in the future in the following
ways:

- Using remote Prettier only to determine options for the remote file,
  but useing local Prettier to do the actual formatting. This would
  help with large source files and slow connections.

- Obviating the need for remote Prettier by walking the remote
  filesystem and finding configuration files. This is unlikely to
  happen because it would mean having to keep `prettier-mode` in sync
  with Prettier configuration discovery logic.

## Customization

```
M-x customize-group prettier
```

### `prettier-mode-sync-config-flag`

Set this to `nil` if you don't want `prettier-mode` to change your
buffer-local settings to match Prettier options.

### `prettier-editorconfig-flag`

Set this to `nil` if you don't want Prettier to use `.editorconfig`
files to load options.

### `prettier-enabled-parsers`

Customize this to match the Prettier version you're using and any
Prettier plugins you have installed.

The default setting assumes that you have a recent version of Prettier
without any plugins.

### `prettier-inline-errors-flag`

Set this to `nil` if you don't like syntax errors to be shown inline
but want them sent to the default error buffer instead.

### `prettier-start-early-flag`

Set this to `nil` if you don't want the Prettier server process to be
started as soon as the minor mode loads. The process will instead be
started the first time it is needed.

## Differences from `prettier-emacs`

- `prettier-emacs` launches `prettier` in an external process, paying
  the Node startup overhead on each invocation unless mitigated by
  tools such as `prettier_d`. `prettier-mode` uses a long-running
  child process. This has the additional benefit of allowing the Node
  V8 runtime to "warm up" over time by improving hot compilation.

- `prettier-emacs` lets Prettier guess the parser to use based on the
  filename. `prettier-mode` instead derives the parser from the major
  mode when possible and falls back to a guess based on the filename
  only when the major mode isn't supported.

- `prettier-emacs` doesn't touch your buffer configuration, such as
  indentation offsets. `prettier-mode`, by default, tries to set the
  buffer configuration to match prettier configuration as closely as
  possible.

- `prettier-mode` keeps point at the same location relative to your
  code; a PR for the same feature in `prettier-emacs` is pending at
  the time of this writing.

- `prettier-mode` has first-class support for editing remote files via
  `tramp-mode` (with some room for improvement for large source files
  and slow connections).

- `prettier-mode` has first-class support for using a local Prettier
  installation (in your project's `node_modules` rather than installed
  globally.)

- `prettier-emacs` allows overriding various Prettier options by
  setting `prettier-js-args` or `prettier-js-width-mode`. In contrast,
  `prettier-mode` believes that your Prettier configuration files
  should serve as the single source of truth.

## Credits

This package is heavily inspired by the original package that
integrated Prettier into Emacs, `prettier-emacs`. Thanks to James
Long, Roman Coedo and all contributors.

Of course, the amazing Prettier itself is what does all the heavy
lifting here. Thanks again to James and to the many people who have
made Prettier into what it is today.
